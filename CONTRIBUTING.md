2. Run `npm run build` to build the project, if possible, if not the bot will do it
3. Please make docs for functions that you make
4. Make commit names like that: "[commit theme]: [commit name]". Example: "Docs: Fixed typo", "API: Removed useless functions", "Chunks: Added new generators", "API_breaking: Rewrote the Logger.js"
